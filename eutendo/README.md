Eutendo - An NES emulator

This is a (very poor) NES emulator that I originally wrote back in 2003 in the Euphoria programming language, which I was using a lot at the time. It is - so far as I can remember - the first emulation-related code I ever wrote.
The original code was in much need of some reorganization, bugfixes and general cleanup.
